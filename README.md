# Abstractive-Text-Summarizer
NLP project on Amazon food reviews dataset using attention based model for text summarization.

Text summarization is nowadays one of the most researched topics in natural language processing (NLP) and has its applications in almost all domains of the internet, for example, e-shops, search engines and news websites that use summaries to give readers an overview of what a particular article might talk about.
Abstractive Text Summarization is a technique of generating summaries by capturing the salient ideas of the text. It aims at converting a long text document into a concise text, which contains the most important facts from the document.
The main objective of this project is to apply abstractive text summarization using attentional encoder-decoder LSTM. The idea is not just about making a mere selection of existing sentences but about a compressed rephrasing with potentially unseen words. It involves a complex process of understanding the language, the context and generating new sentences. Furthermore, using LSTM encoder-decoder manner leads us to Sequence-To-Sequence architecture, which is one of the most used and best-performing approaches in machine translation.
